## Chapter 1

Always have a challenge. Focus on said challenge and remove as many distractions as possible

Don't be afraid of failure, don't give up. Start over or redo things if you've learned how to do it better.

Enable yourself to get rapid feedback

Be bold. You need the confidence in yourself to start and keep going.

Analyze the topic and look at successful examples. Then practice as soon as possible 

Put in the time and effort. You cannot half-ass this. This is hard but worth it.

Ultralearners are found in all kind of professions and hobbies. They usually work alone. 

The book aims to find common strategies between the different ultralearners and wants to show ways to apply them to daily life even if you do not quit your full time job for it. 

## Chapter 2: Why Ultralearning matters

A strategy for acquiring skills and knowledge that is both self directed and intense 

It's a strategy - not the only solution and part of your toolbox. You CHOOSE this strategy, you do not have to use it. 

It's self directed - you decide why, how and what to learn. You are in the driver's seat 

It's intense - you commit and do the hard mental work. It's not optimized for fun, it's optimized for deeply and effectively learning things. 

So why do it?
For work. Nicht treiben lassen, bestimmen deine Karriere selbst. Ultralearning ist intensiv, aber weniger intensiv als 40 Stunden in der Woche zu arbeiten.

For your private life. It gives a sense of accomplishment, it gives you something to be proud 

"Average is over" - the gap between high skill and low skill jobs is getting bigger with no in-between. Ultralearning can enable you to get those high skill jobs. 

Skill gaps from school, constantly changing fields
