**Hello World! ✌️**

If you've found this small corner of the internet, you probably already know me. But in case you do not:

Hi, my name is Anita. Nice to meet you!

As a senior software engineer with over a decade of experience, I embrace life long learning and enjoy mentoring and teaching. I am a firm believer that it's the people who make our jobs, and lives, worthwhile and fun which is why I strive to build connections and empower others. 

I want to use this place to share my thoughts on my experiences and favorite topics, some of which are
* test driven development, software architecture, working with legacy code
* functional programming, elixir
* team culture, continuous learning, pair programming
* quick development pace, getting value to the customer
* networking, community building, working out loud
* swimming, rescue swimming
* mentoring, teaching, conferences

But I don't want to just yell into the void. So come find me on:
