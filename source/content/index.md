**Hello World! ✌️**

If you've found this small corner of the internet, you probably already know me. But in case you do not: Hi, my name is Anita. Nice to meet you!

As a senior software engineer with over a decade of experience, I enjoy learning as well as mentoring and teaching. I am firm believer that empowering each other and building strong networks, makes life not only easier but also more fun.  

That's why I want to use this place to share my thoughts on my favorite topics, some of which are
* test driven development, software architecture, working with legacy code
* team culture, continuous learning, pair programming
* quick development pace, getting value to the customer
* networking, community building, working out loud
* swimming, rescue swimming
* mentoring, teaching and talking

And I want to invite you to do the same. So come find me on:
